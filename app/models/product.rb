#Add a custom methods called search to the product model to search for a product with its title or description if it contains a specific word. For instance you should be able to do:

# Product.search("car")
# Which should return all the products that have the word car in it's title or description (case insensitive).

  # scope(:search, -> (query) { where("title ILIKE ? OR description ILIKE ?", "%#{query}%", "%#{query}%") })

# Challenge: Show the products that contain the searched word in their title before the ones that contain the searched word only in the description. For instance, if a product contains the word car in its title, it should before a product that only contains the word car only in the description.

# Approach: Do two or three separate searches that only have either the title or desciption.
